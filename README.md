Icon Creator
============

The Icon Creator project was developed as an interactive way to create icons for use in Modelica based tools. After an icon is created, the Modelica code for the annotation can be copied and pasted.

## Preview
Using two Rectangles and a Polygon, the Canadian flag can be created graphically:

Afterwards, the display can be switched to the Modelica view where the code can be copied:

## Motivation
This side project came to life for a few reasons:
- An interest in creating software-like programs
- A personal challenge to push myself to learn how to program objects using Maple&trade;
- At the time I was creating Modelica icons for work purposes

## Setup
Clone this repo and open IconCreator.mw. The source code will automatically be read.

**Note:** Running the Icon Creator project will require a valid Maple&trade; license.

## Design
The user interface and code is all programmed using the Maple&trade; programming language.
